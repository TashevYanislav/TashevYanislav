### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Yanislav Tashev !

ðŸš€ Junior JavaScript developer with a passion for crafting elegant and functional web solutions. Currently diving deep into the world of web development, I'm eager to contribute to projects that challenge and inspire me.

ðŸ’¼ As a recent graduate of SoftUni , I've gained hands-on experience with JavaScript,TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and various libraries and frameworks like React, Angular and Node.js. While I may be a junior developer, I bring enthusiasm, a strong work ethic, and a hunger for learning to every project I undertake.

ðŸŒ± Constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set, I'm dedicated to growing as a developer and to collaborative projects. Whether it's debugging code, designing user interfaces, or implementing new features, I'm always up for the challenge!

ðŸ“« Let's connect! I'm always open to new connections and learning experiences. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn - let's code together!
